# Windows2DGraphics
These files include my testing of 2D graphics for Windows systems which will eventually be used in my other C++ projects.

BaseWindow.h and main.cpp can/will be used in other programs (Given they create the MainWindow class). 
The other classes were only added to test some of the Win32 API features.
